## Why did you fork Reach?

Compatibility issues with React 18. I'm reasonably certain that most of the compatibility issues arise from flexibility I'm not interested in. All I really want is a minimal component library managing accessibility, and a stripped down set of Reach packages seems like a reasonable path forward.

<!--
I'm sure it would be better to contribute back to Reach by helping fix up its compatibility issues, but that's a bigger commitment than I'm willing to make at my current skill level.
